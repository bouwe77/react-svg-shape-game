# react-svg-shape-game

# TO DO

- Rename `isAnswer` prop to something more clear
- Refactor (deduplicate) `isAnswer` + `strokes` code: CSS Styles?
- Rename `noop` to `noShape`, or whatever...
- Randomize initial `expectedShapes` and `actualShapes`
- Make shapes initially blue
- When "Done", and incorrect, make them red otherwise green
